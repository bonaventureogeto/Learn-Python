Create a program that reads in a CSV file containing information about books (title, author, ISBN, and price), and then allows the user to search for books by author, ISBN, or price range.

Step 1: Create a function that takes a file name as an argument and reads in the contents of the file as a list of dictionaries, with each dictionary representing a book and containing keys for title, author, ISBN, and price.

Step 2: Create a function that takes an author's name as an argument and returns a list of all books written by that author.

Step 3: Create a function that takes an ISBN as an argument and returns the title and price of the book with that ISBN.

Step 4: Create a function that takes a minimum and maximum price as arguments and returns a list of all books within that price range.

Step 5: Use the functions from steps 2-4 in a user interface that allows the user to search for books by author, ISBN, or price range.

Bonus: Add the ability for the user to add new books to the CSV file.
